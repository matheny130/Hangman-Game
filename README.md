**Superhero Hangman**

In this game you will have a set number of guesses, based on the length of the hero's name, to guess the letters needed to complete the hero's name. If you get the name right a picture of the hero will appear for a brief time before beginning a new game. The page automatically keeps track of number of games won, number of guesses remaining, and letters you have already guessed; both correct and incorrect. After a win or a loss the game will automatically restart without user having to prompt it.
